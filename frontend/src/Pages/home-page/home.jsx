              The Shadow Program, organized by the Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC), is a one-day initiative that connects students with distinguished alumni in their workplaces. It offers firsthand exposure to real-world work environments, helping bridge the gap between academics and industry. Through professional interactions and workplace visits, students gain insights into career paths, company culture, and industry trendsâ€”beyond what textbooks offer.
